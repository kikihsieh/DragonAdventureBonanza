# Dragon Adventure Bonanza

### Milestone 1: Skeletal Game

#### Rendering: 
* Main dragon character, multiple spiders, ground, and one platform is rendered in the correct drawing order
* 2D Transformations and key-frame/state interpolation of the dragon and spiders based on their movement

#### Gameplay: 
Walking and jumping
* The player is able to move forwards/backwards and jump based on keyboard controls
* Define our game space boundaries (boundary collision management)
    * Gamespace boundaries are defined in world.cpp
    * There are boundaries on the left, right, top, and bottom of the level
    * The player cannot move past the left, right, and top boundaries
    * Touching the bottom boundary kills the player
* Collisions with environment obstacles and enemies
    * Player is able to collide with platforms from all directions
    * No collisions with enemies (yet)
* Enemies move back and forth within a defined area
* Enemies position is randomized for now, once the tile system is introduced in, will be able to statically position enemies and platforms 

#### Creative Component: 
* Camera-follow: camera follows player as they move across the screen. The camera adapts to forward/backward movement and smoothly transitions between the two states
    * Camera does not stop at the correct position in relation to  world boundaries 
* Double jump: If the ability is unlocked, the player can jump a second time while in the air. Landing on the ground or a platform will reset the jumps.
* Gravity 

#### Robustness:
* No severe lag
* Resolution / ratio is consistent (1200 x 800) 
* No crashes

#### Items missing from development plan: 
We implemented features not mentioned in the development plan for this week in place of these items as we found that they were more vital to the basic game definition. These include the camera-follow, tile system, and gravity/ double jump. 
* ECS design: We focused on gameplay mechanics and will update to ECS design as we find common elements to combine
* Walking enemy AI (platform bound): we decided to change to a tile system for defining platforms before attempting to place enemies on them. We also plan to use the tile system to place the spiders. As this is an additional feature that we did not anticipate implementing, we did not have the time to implement platform bound enemies. 
* Collisions with enemies: collisions for platforms is working which can in turn be easily reused to provide collisions with enemies

#### In progress: 
* Tile system: we are currently working on a tile system to define the location of platforms and general level design. This is already working except collisions with platforms declared in this way are not yet implemented. (itâ€™s on the tile_system branch)
* Collisions with enemies
* Enemies dropping in y-direction at random time
